            <h3>Who?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Teacher Ana is a passionate educator who found her calling in teaching at a young age. As a teenager, she
                developed a
                deep love for history, inspiring her to pursue a degree in the subject with the dream of becoming a
                university
                professor. Education ran in her blood as her mother was a dedicated math teacher. After completing her
                studies, she
                embarked on an enriching journey, studying abroad in Canada. Upon returning to Brazil, destiny led her
                to discover a new
                path in teaching English at a language school. Over the years, she not only honed her teaching skills
                but also found
                love and companionship, meeting the person who would become her husband. However, life's challenges
                brought her to a
                turning point when she had to work long hours just to make ends meet. It was during this time that she
                discovered her
                true calling as a Tutor, leading her towards an exciting and fulfilling journey.</p>

        <div id="why">
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Teacher Ana's decision to become an educator was deeply rooted in her passion for sharing knowledge and
                empowering
                others. Her love for history drove her towards the path of teaching at the university level. However,
                life's
                circumstances led her to explore new opportunities in teaching English. Through this experience, she
                discovered the joy
                of helping students grasp a new language, building meaningful connections with them, and witnessing
                their growth and
                progress. Her dedication and commitment to her students became evident as she poured her heart and soul
                into every
                lesson. Teaching became more than just a profession; it became a calling, as she realized the impact she
                could have on
                shaping young minds and empowering them to achieve their dreams.</p>

        <div id="how">
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As Teacher Ana prepared to take maternity leave after having her second daughter during a global
                pandemic, she needed to
                find capable teachers to replace her. This experience inspired her to mentor aspiring educators in
                private tutoring.
                Combining her own experiences and innovative ideas, she created the VHS method. This approach blended
                traditional and
                modern teaching techniques to help students reach their full potential while supporting the growth and
                success of
                teachers. The VHS method became a symbol of Teacher Ana's commitment to education, spreading the wonders
                of private
                tutoring to inspire teachers and students alike.</p>
