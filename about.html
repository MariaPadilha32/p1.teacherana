                <p id="aboutfour-description" aria-describedby="aboutfour-image"> I always wanted to be a teacher! It
                    was my favorite playtime. Even though I graduated and did a
                    master's
                    degree in History, English found its place in my heart during the first accidental substitution
                    class I
                    taught at the first school I worked as a history teacher. In 2012, I started teaching at a language
                    school, believe it or not, I worked up to 54 hours a week! It was a great learning experience for
                    me,
                    but
                    I started to
                    feel constrained by the school's methodology, feeling like I couldn't provide my students with the
                    help
                    they deserved.
                    I started teaching at the encouragement of my eternal partner, my husband. And in 2015, with a lot
                    of
                    uncertainty, not knowing how or where to begin, I had my first student. Since my workload at the
                    school
                    was very heavy, and I was afraid of getting laid off, I ended up with 5 private students by the end
                    of
                    the year. </p>

                <!--Paragraph 2 -->
                <p id="aboutseven-description" aria-describedby="aboutseven-image"> But then, the first change in my
                    life began. I got married and lost half of the hours I had at the
                    school. Necessity pushed me to dive fully into private lessons. To the point that in 2018, I decided
                    to
                    leave the school definitively and live off private lessons. By the end of the year, my schedule was
                    full, with nearly 40 students, and I was earning R$ 12,500! However, an end-of-year surprise led me
                    to
                    another change. In 2019, just before Bia was born, my first daughter, because I wanted to experience
                    motherhood as intensely as I wanted to maintain my professional career, I needed to find time in my
                    busy schedule of students and at the same time, maintain the same income.

                <!--Paragraph 3 -->
                <p id="aboutthree-description" aria-describedby="aboutthree-image"> And it was in this transformative
                    moment of my life that my career took a new direction, and I took
                    the
                    first step to turn my private lessons into a profitable business, working half as much and
                    maintaining
                    an income above R$ 10,000. Seeing what I had achieved, a desire to share my experiences was born
                    within
                    me. I thought, 'It's not fair that only I get to experience motherhood so deeply and witness my
                    professional career
                    flourishing. And that's when my second daughter, Maria Luiza, came into the world. Forced to take
                    maternity leave and training two teachers to replace me during that time, I
                    realized: I had created a method! </p>

                <p id="abouttwo-description" aria-describedby="abouttwo-image">At this moment, I realized how much I
                    wanted to teach other teachers everything that my journey as a
                    teacher-mother-entrepreneur had taught me. And the brand "Teacher Ana de Araujo" emerged, my
                    microenterprise that was born to guide and steer the growth of other teachers who also want to make
                    a
                    good and dignified living from private lessons.</p>
