        <p class="introduction">Welcome to my website! I'm so excited to have you here. As a mentor for teachers, I know
            firsthand the
            struggles and
            challenges we face when trying to make enough money while still having time for the most important people in
            our lives –
            our kids. I've been on this journey myself, trying to strike that perfect balance between work and family.
            But you know
            what? I finally cracked the code! I found a successful method that allowed me to earn more and work less,
            giving me the
            precious moments I needed with my kids.

            And you know what's even better? I couldn't keep this success to myself. I knew I had to share it with my
            fellow
            teachers, so they could experience the same level of fulfillment and joy in their careers and family lives.
            That's why
            I'm here – to empower you with the strategies and tools that have worked wonders for me. Together, we can
            elevate the
            lives of educators, create a thriving community, and make a real impact on the generations we touch. So,
            join me on this
            transformative journey, and let's make teaching not only a fulfilling career but also a beautiful journey
            with our loved
            ones by our side. I can't wait to see what we can achieve together!</p>

            <h3>Teacher Kamilly</h3>
            <p>"Ana, another incredible content from your mentoring! More valuable knowledge to study and apply! In
                March, my gross income increased by 50% compared to February! And in April, I achieved my first 10k!
                No
                words to
                thank you for ALL your individual attention!!! You know my business even better than I do. I trust
                your
                guidance with my
                eyes closed."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Teacher Sarah</h3>
            <p>"We didn't know where to start, and God put you in our path to guide us and take the first steps, the
                famous 'tidying up
                the house,' and it made ALL the difference! Now, our meetings are done only through video, and we
                develop classes based
                on the students' needs. It was incredible, Ana! We still have many things to discuss, but everything
                we
                have seen so far
                with your course and mentoring has already boosted us! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3> Maria Luiza, Student</h3>
            <p>"Teacher Ana was wonderful. You can bring didactics and lightness to the students, even when we are
                just
                starting. I see
                how you put LOVE into your work. You think about every detail. You bring intentions like
                gamifications
                to make learning
                more fun. I'm your fan. Everyone needs to know about your existence; you're amazing. Thank you for
                everything! This
                experience was incredible. May there be even more to come."</p>

            <h3>Teacher Ricardo</h3>
            <p>"The masterclass is helping me waste less time in planning and organize the lessons better.
                Gratitude!
                Whenever I can, I
                binge-watch your Youtube channel, so much good information! Thank you."</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Teacher Beatriz</h3>
            <p>"I started following your profile through one of your partners and found the content interesting. I
                saw
                your invitation
                to the pricing Live and got curious about the VHS method, especially when you said that the price
                was
                not a 'guess.'
                Because I thought that in my city, I couldn't charge much, I participated with some skepticism. But
                on
                the same day of
                the Live in the morning, when I answered your question box and saw your reply, it was a 'wake-up
                call,
                dear!' And
                learned to let go of those who don't value me. And you can earn more with fewer students, working
                less."
